# EXAMPLES

## mover

Example `mover` manually moves vehicles around the track cars by
respositioning. There is no actual driving or game play.

The coordinates for each vehicle are reported on the message board,
which makes this a good program to interactively explore Track and
Cartesian coordinate space representations.


## drive

Example `drive` drives any number of vehicles on a track.

One vehicle is selected at a time, and the selected vehicle's track
direction, speed, and lane position can be changed. There is no actual
game play.


## zoneshapes

Example `zoneshapes` shows usage of track regions and game shapes. The
track regions are drawn on the track, and each region triggers the
appearance of one or more game shapes when a vehicle enters it. There
is no actual game play.


## sidetap

Example game `sidetap` is a very simple game that demonstrates vehicle
collisions and non-standard vehicle lights. Win the game by colliding
to knock out your opponent's side lights.
